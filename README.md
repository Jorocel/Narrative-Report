# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Introduction

This document provides an in-depth exploration of core data structures and algorithms that are fundamental to computer engineering. These include sorting algorithms, resizable arrays, hash tables, binary search trees (BSTs), and single-source shortest paths (SSSP). Each concept is explained in detail with its principles, operations, applications, and challenges.

## 1. Sorting Algorithms

Sorting is a fundamental computational task that involves reordering a collection of items into a specific sequence. Sorting is essential in various applications, such as searching, organizing data, and preprocessing for other algorithms. Different sorting techniques cater to diverse needs, balancing factors like efficiency, stability, and simplicity.

### Bubble Sort
- This algorithm repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- It is intuitive and easy to implement but inefficient for large datasets.
- Works well as a teaching tool to introduce sorting concepts.

**Time Complexity:**
- Worst Case: \(O(N^2)\)
- Best Case: \(O(N)\) (when the array is already sorted).

### Selection Sort
- This algorithm identifies the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
- Simpler than Bubble Sort but also inefficient for large datasets.

**Time Complexity:**
- Worst and Best Case: \(O(N^2)\)

### Insertion Sort
- Builds the sorted array incrementally by picking elements one at a time and inserting them into their correct position.
- Effective for small or nearly sorted datasets.

**Time Complexity:**
- Worst Case: \(O(N^2)\)
- Best Case: \(O(N)\) (when the array is nearly sorted).

### Merge Sort
- A divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively splits the array into halves, sorts each half, and merges them into a single sorted array.
- Guarantees \(O(N \log N)\) performance in all cases.
- Stable and works well with linked lists.

### Quick Sort
- Selects a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively applies the same strategy to the subarrays.
- Highly efficient but can degrade to \(O(N^2)\) if poor pivot selection occurs.
- Average case is \(O(N \log N)\).

### Heap Sort
- Uses a binary heap data structure to sort the array efficiently.
- Ensures \(O(N \log N)\) performance but is not stable.
- Suitable for systems where memory overhead is a concern.

### Radix Sort
- A non-comparison-based algorithm that processes integers digit by digit.
- Works well with uniformly distributed data and guarantees \(O(N \cdot d)\) complexity, where \(d\) is the number of digits in the largest number.

Sorting algorithms are indispensable in modern computing, underpinning efficient searching, data analysis, and the functioning of higher-level algorithms.

## 2. Resizable Arrays

Resizable arrays are dynamic versions of static arrays, enabling adaptive storage to accommodate variable-sized datasets. They are ubiquitous in programming languages like Python (lists), Java (ArrayList), and C++ (vector).

### Foundations and Characteristics
- **Compact Storage:** Resizable arrays aim to maintain compactness, ensuring all elements are sequentially stored without gaps, simplifying indexing and traversal.
- **Dynamic Resizing:** When the capacity is reached, the array dynamically resizes, typically doubling in size. This ensures amortized \(O(1)\) time complexity for appending operations.

### Core Operations
1. **Access:** Direct indexing provides \(O(1)\) performance.
2. **Search:** Linear for unsorted arrays (\(O(N)\)); binary search for sorted arrays (\(O(\log N)\)).
3. **Insert/Delete:** Efficient at the end (\(O(1)\)); elsewhere requires shifting elements (\(O(N)\)).

### Applications
Resizable arrays are widely used in scenarios requiring dynamic data management, such as:

- **Dynamic Lists:** Providing flexible size adjustments.
- **Queue and Stack Implementations:** Leveraging efficient append and pop operations.
- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms:** Supporting operations like binary search when sorted.

---

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages
- Efficient use of memory with automatic resizing.
- Fast access due to compact storage.

### Limitations
- Overhead during resizing due to element copying.
- Performance degradation when frequent resizing occurs.

---

## 3. Hash Tables

Hash tables provide a highly efficient means of key-value mapping, offering average \(O(1)\) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups.

## Key Features

- **Hash Function:** Transforms keys into indices, ensuring a uniform distribution to minimize collisions.
- **Operations:**
  - **Search:** Quickly locate a value using its key.
  - **Insert:** Add a key-value pair into the table.
  - **Delete:** Remove a key-value pair, maintaining the structure's integrity.

---

## Collision Resolution Strategies

1. **Separate Chaining:** Uses linked lists at each index to handle multiple keys hashing to the same value.
   - Pros: Easy to implement, works well with high load factors.
   - Cons: Linked list overhead may affect performance.
2. **Open Addressing:** Probes alternative indices when collisions occur.
   - Techniques:
     - **Linear Probing:** Checks consecutive indices until an empty slot is found.
     - **Quadratic Probing:** Jumps by increasing intervals to resolve collisions.
     - **Double Hashing:** Applies a secondary hash function for further dispersion.

---

## Applications

- **Associative Arrays:** Maps like Python’s `dict` or Java’s `HashMap`.
- **Database Indexing:** Optimizes data retrieval operations.
- **Caching Mechanisms:** Provides quick access to frequently used data.

---

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages
- Efficient average-case time complexity for core operations.
- Adaptable to various key types, including strings and integers.

### Limitations
- Poor performance with poorly designed hash functions or high collision rates.
- Requires rehashing when the load factor becomes too high.

## 4. Binary Search Trees (BSTs)

Binary Search Trees (BSTs) organize data hierarchically, adhering to the property where the left subtree of a node contains smaller values and the right subtree contains larger values.

## Key Characteristics

- **BST Property:** For any node \(X\), all values in the left subtree are less than \(X\), and all values in the right subtree are greater than \(X\).
- **Dynamic Structure:** BSTs can dynamically adapt to changes, making them suitable for various applications like dynamic sets or ordered maps.

---

## Core Operations

1. **Search:** Locate a specific value in \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree. Searching is efficient because it follows the tree's structure, descending left or right depending on comparisons.
2. **Insert:** Add a new value while preserving the BST property. The time complexity is \(O(h)\).
3. **Delete:** Remove a value, adjusting the tree to maintain its properties. Deletion can involve replacing nodes with their in-order predecessor or successor, running in \(O(h)\).

---

## Traversal Techniques

- **In-order Traversal:** Produces values in ascending order.
- **Pre-order Traversal:** Visits the root before its subtrees.
- **Post-order Traversal:** Visits subtrees before the root.

---

## Balanced Binary Search Trees

An important subclass of BSTs includes balanced trees, such as AVL trees. Balanced BSTs maintain a height of \(O(\log N)\), ensuring optimal performance for all operations.

---

## Applications

- **Databases and Indexing:** BSTs efficiently handle range queries and data organization.
- **Dynamic Sets:** Useful for tasks like maintaining ordered data or dynamic sorting.
- **Priority Scheduling:** Variants like AVL or Red-Black Trees are critical for managing dynamically changing datasets.

---

## Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages
- Efficient search, insert, and delete operations.
- In-order traversal provides sorted data.

### Limitations
- Performance can degrade to \(O(N)\) in unbalanced trees, necessitating balanced versions like AVL or Red-Black Trees.

---

## 5. Single-Source Shortest Paths (SSSP)

The SSSP problem involves finding the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a graph.

### Key Algorithms
1. **Bellman-Ford Algorithm:** Solves the general case with \(O(V \times E)\) complexity. Handles negative weight edges and detects negative cycles.
2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Optimized for graphs with non-negative weights, achieving \(O((V+E) \log V)\) complexity using priority queues.

### Special Cases
- **BFS (\(O(V+E)\)):** Handles unweighted graphs efficiently.
- **DAGs:** Topological sorting enables \(O(V+E)\).

### Applications
- Navigation systems, network routing, and scheduling.

### Challenges
- Handling negative weight cycles and scaling algorithms for large datasets remain significant concerns.
